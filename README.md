# newbie-tuts
Copy/pasteable tutorials for new users on getting started with Mudlet, everything from connecting to a game to making your triggers and UIs.

# is it ready yet?

**NO!** This is still a work in progress. Please direct newbies who want to learn to the [screencasts](www.mudlet.org/media/) and [Mudlet Manual](http://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Contents) instead, there are lots of examples and walkthoughs to follow there.

# vision
If you know how difficult explaining to someone what a MUD is, then you'll understand the need for this! MUDs aren't graphical, scrolling text isn't an idea that comes naturally, yet the freedom they offer is unparalleled. This project aims to help newbies get jumpstarted in using Mudlet to play MUDs - how to make aliases, triggers, and provide plenty of examples for people to copy/paste from.

It should:
* guide people how to connect to a MUD when they open Mudlet for the first time
* pre-install on the first 3 profiles that the new mudder creates
* include examples on how to make _everything_ in mudlet, so it should have:
* many, many sample aliases and show people how to try them out
* same for triggers - includes many, many triggers that do various things and an easy way to showcase them
* same for scripts, keys, timers, buttons
* it shouldn't limit itself - making UIs, using GMCP, everything you can do in Mudlet should be included
* on top of all of these things available in the Mudlet editor, a UI should also introduce all of this to the newbie in a friendly manner - because opening up a folder with 100 aliases in it is going to be overwhelming. The UI also should:
  * walk people through making their own aliases, triggers, scripts, etc using some sort of a step-by-step tutorial system
* everything should be easy to try out, so people can fiddle with an example and re-try it to see the result
* this project in itself should be copy/pasteable; it will follow Mudlet best practices for developing packages and enable people to get setup with their own projects
