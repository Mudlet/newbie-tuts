# newbie-tuts
A tutorial for new users on how to get started with Mudlet, everything from connecting to a game to making your triggers and UIs.

# vision
If you know how difficult explaining to someone what a MUD is, then you'll understand the need for this! MUDs aren't graphical, scrolling text isn't an idea that comes naturally, yet the freedom they offer is unparalleled. This project aims to help newbies get jumpstarted in using Mudlet to play MUDs - how to make aliases, triggers, and provide plenty of examples for people to copy/paste from.

It should:
* point people how to connect to a MUD on their first time
* pre-install on the first 3 profiles that the new mudder creates
* include a simple, but functional graphical UI that:
  * include many, many sample aliases and show people how to try them out
  * walk people through making their own aliases
  * same for triggers - include many, many triggers that do various things and an easy way to showcase them
  * walk people through making their own triggers
  * and the same for scripts, keys, timers, buttons
  * it shouldn't stop anywhere - making UIs, using GMCP, everything should be included
