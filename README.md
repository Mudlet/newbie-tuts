# newbie-tuts
Copy/pasteable tutorials for new users on getting started with Mudlet, everything from connecting to a game to making your triggers and UIs.

# vision
If you know how difficult explaining to someone what a MUD is, then you'll understand the need for this! MUDs aren't graphical, scrolling text isn't an idea that comes naturally, yet the freedom they offer is unparalleled. This project aims to help newbies get jumpstarted in using Mudlet to play MUDs - how to make aliases, triggers, and provide plenty of examples for people to copy/paste from.

It should:
* guide people how to connect to a MUD when they open Mudlet for the first time
* pre-install on the first 3 profiles that the new mudder creates, and
* include an aesthetic and functional graphical UI that:
  * includes many, many sample aliases and show people how to try them out
  * walks people through making their own aliases
  * same for triggers - includes many, many triggers that do various things and an easy way to showcase them
  * walk people through making their own triggers
  * same for scripts, keys, timers, buttons
  * it shouldn't limit itself - making UIs, using GMCP, everything you can do in Mudlet should be included
* this project in itself should be copy/pasteable; it will follow Mudlet best practices for developing packages and enable people to get setup with their own projects
